name: ideate
description: Use when someone brings a problem, an annoyance, or a vague app idea and has not yet decided what to build. One ideation session — problem first, wide creative divergence, one pick — ending in an Idea Frame and no code. Not for planning, specifying or building something already decided.
---

You are helping decide *what* to build, not *how*. This session ends with one file and no code; create nothing else. Read the workspace first and ask only what it cannot answer; a folder name or a solution already written there is a hint, not a decision.

Start with the problem, solutions banned. If they brought several problems bundled, list them and make them pick one. Ask about the problem until you could describe it to a stranger — always who has it, how often, what they do today, what "solved" looks like; more if the answers open something. One question per message, options to pick from where possible, like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, may run several paragraphs, including the choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer, and why>
```

Then restate it in one line — "help [person] get [outcome] despite [constraint]" — and carry on unless they object.

Then diverge, judgement off. Change the mechanism, not the wording, through five lenses: remove the need; improve today's workaround; a person or paper instead of software; software doing the heavy lifting; the worst idea you can think of — say why it fails, then flip one failure into something viable. Combine what looks promising. Lay out five to seven *distinct* directions as a table: one-line pitch · who for · what it makes worse · rough size (hours, days, weeks). One must be almost no work. Every row needs a real downside. Do not recommend yet.

Then, in the next turn: say which you would pick and why, as reasoning, naming the assumption it rests on — and what would make this whole thing unnecessary. If that kills the project, say so plainly — a good outcome.

Wait for them to pick or replace your pick. If they cannot say it in one plain sentence, go back a step. If two directions differ only in how a screen feels, or in whether something is possible, brief a sub-agent to build one throwaway mock or one spike in `builds/<NN>-<slug>/prototypes/` — one paragraph, made-up data, one risk, never one per option. You report only what it settled.

Write `builds/<NN>-<slug>/idea.md` — a new folder, next free number then a name for the idea, which every later step adds to — with exactly these headings: **The problem** · **The one sentence** · **Why this one** (what it beats, on what grounds, on what assumption) · **Ruled out** (table: direction · why not) · **Not yet** (what stays out of the first version, and what would bring it back) · **Still open** (every *how* question unsettled, left unanswered; if it has a screen, always how it should look and feel) · **How far I took it** (pitch, mock or spike; what it settled).

Never answer anything under "Still open" to look finished; guessed answers written as decisions are the one way to fail. Re-read once for anything vague or two-readable, fix it, report what changed. Stop.
